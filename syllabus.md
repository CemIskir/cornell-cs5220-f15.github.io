## Course work

Core principles:
- We're all learning different things; be mindful of prereqs, but
  don't panic.
- It's all public -- be inspired, but cite
  - I can track the flow of ideas easily enough (so can anyone)
- Class is for active learning rather than lecture
  - Bring a laptop!  You'll want it.
- You'll evaluate yourselves and each other; I'm here as a guide

"Unless there's some special reason, I want all the repositories to be
public -- the kids have plenty of ways of sharing information without
us knowing about it so I'd rather try to create a culture of sharing
with attribution."
https://github.com/education/teachers/issues/2#issuecomment-46861804

Cite.

We will not look at every line of code, or even most of them.

Repo per project vs repo per course

### Reading

### Homework

Assignment 0: Pull request against the "who are you?" survey.

### Projects

### Class material

Class material will be posted on GitHub, and any merged pull requests
(corrections or additions to course notes, better solutions than ours,
tests that uncover interesting problems, suggested exercises, etc)
will be given extra credit.

## Grading

Point is not to grade you, it is for you to learn.

## Course policies

### Late work policy

Homework is due by 11:59 on the due date.  Resubmissions up to the
deadline are safe, but late submissions are not accepted.  The
lowest homework grade will be dropped in computing your final score.

Projects are due at 11:59 on the initial due date.  Projects that are
not submitted on time for peer review may still be submitted for the
final deadline; however, they will receive a 10% grade penalty and
will not receive the benefit of a review.  Peer reviews and
the final (post-review) version must be submitted on time.

### Collaboration

An assignment is an academic document, like a journal article.
When you turn it in, you are claiming everything in it is your
original work, *unless you cite a source for it*.

You are welcome to discuss homework and projects among yourselves in
general terms.  However, you should not look at code or writeups from
other students, or allow other students to see your code or writeup,
even if the general solution was worked out together.  Unless we
explicitly allow it on an assignment, we will not credit code or
writeups that are shared between students (or teams, in the case of
projects).

If you get an idea from a classmate, the TA, a book or other published
source, or elsewhere, please provide an appropriate citation.  This is
not only critical to maintaining academic integrity, but it is also an
important way for you to give credit to those who have helped you out.
When in doubt, cite!  Code or writeups with appropriate citations will
never be considered a violation of academic integrity in this class
(though you will not receive credit for code or writeups that were
shared when you should have done them yourself).

### Academic Integrity

We expect academic integrity from everyone.  School is stressful,
and you may feel pressure from your coursework or other factors,
but that is no reason for dishonesty!  If you feel you can't complete
the work on the own, come talk to the professor, the TA, or your advisor,
and we can help you figure out what to do.

For more information, see Cornell's 
[Code of Academic Integrity](http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html).

All work will be public on GitHub, and we encourage you to be inspired
by work of others.  But cite, and be aware of your own learning experience!

### Emergency procedures

In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a
revised semester calendar or other circumstances.  Any such announcements will
be posted to [the course home page](index.html).
