# CS 5220: Applications of Parallel Computers
Prof. David Bindel  
TR 8:45-9:99, 203 Phillips
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Objectives

- Reason about code performance
  - Many factors: hardware, software, algorithms
  - Want simple, "good enough" models
- Apply model numerical HPC patterns
- Tune existing codes for modern HW
- Apply good software practices
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Prereqs

Guided by basic logistical constraints:

- Default class codes will be in C
- Our focus is numerical codes

Fine if you're not a numerical C hacker!

- I want a diverse class
- Most will have *some* holes
- Come to us if you have concerns
</section>

## Usual Logistics

- Home: [cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io](http://cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io)
- Read [the syllabus](http://cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io/syllabus.html)
- Enroll if you'll take the class
- Grading breakdown
  - Class participation + HW (20%)
  - Standard group projects + peer review (50%)
  - Final project (30%)

</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Unusual Logistics

- Intel Xeon Phi cluster
- Git-oriented workflows
- Public development work
- Flipped classroom (bring laptops!)

More on all of this in a bit!
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## How many are you?

Let's try the following simple counting protocol:

- Rightmost person counts number in each row
- When done counting, raise hand
- State number when called on

Estimate how long should this take.  Then let's see!
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## How many are you?

Would it be more efficient for me to count?

- Time to start the process?
- Time to compute vs communicate?
- Opportunity for parallelism?
- Balanced work partition?
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Who are you?

Icebreaker: Greet your neighbors  
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Who are you?

How many have or are pursuing
- A CS degree?
- Engineering degree (outside CS)?
- Other science degree (outside CS)?
- Other degrees?
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Who are you?

How many are
- Undergraduates?
- Masters students?
- PhD students?
- Other?
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## HW0: Who are you?

- Create a [GitHub account](http://www.github.com)
- Fill out Assignment 0:
  - Netid and GitHub account
  - Demographic information
  - Why taking the course
- Submit via CMS
</section>


<section data-markdown>
## Logistics: Accounts

You'll need two accounts:

- Cluster account (netid login)
  - I'll start with facultycenter enrollment
  - Help me out: enroll or send me email!
- GitHub account (may be pseudonymous)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Xeon Phi cluster

- Fancy HW toy courtesy Intel + Dell discount
  - Eight 12-core host nodes
  - Fifteen 60-core Xeon Phi accelerators
- Typical HPC software environment
  - Linux base + environment modules
  - Submission via batch queue

This is a *new cluster* -- expect some issues and be patient!
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Logistics: GitHub

- Default for distributing work *and* submitting
  - *Very* common software workflow
  - Public code = bragging rights
  - You learn from your peers
- Privacy concerns
  - Respect the privacy of your peers!
  - Grades and such stay on [CMS](http://cms.csuglab.cornell.edu/)
  - May stay pseudonymous [(use private email)](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
  - Can opt out without penalty -- come talk to me
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Logistics: GitHub

- Submit work via *pull requests*
  - Course corrections/additions for extra credit!
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Flipping

- Lectures and reading out of class
- Class time for collaboration and interaction
  - Discussions of readings
  - Pair programming
  - Guided problem work
- Bring a laptop if you've got one!
</section>  

<section data-markdown>
## Out of class

- Class preparation work
  - Readings + responses, short exercises, etc
  - You *may* update responses during/after class
- Group projects
  - Parallelization / tuning of existing codes
  - Performance analysis is a big component
  - Groups assigned to mix background
- Final project
  - Research track: write a paper
  - Teaching track: develop a module
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Projects

- Deliverables
  - Tuned (and correct) code
  - Written report with reproducible experiments
- Three or so during semester
- Assigned small groups
- Comes with milestones
- Work is peer reviewed
- Groups also self-assess
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Sharing

- Default: class code (including yours) is open
  - Goal: *study* and *improve* peer codes
  - Caveat: *cite* what inspires you
  - Bulk copying with citation still scores low
- Peer review partly to force sharing
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Late work

- In-class work and peer review need timely work
- Two parts to grade: initial and final submission
  - Get feedback on initial submission
  - Correct issues before final submission
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Final projects

- Deliverables
  - Tuned (and correct) code
  - Written report with reproducible experiments
- Three or so during semester
- Assigned small groups
- Comes with milestones
- Work is peer reviewed
- Groups also self-assess
</section>
