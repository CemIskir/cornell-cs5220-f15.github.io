We had 110 students in the first class of the semester!  There's
homework up for the second class:

 - [HW0: Getting to know you](http://github.com/cornell-cs5220-f15/hw0)
 - [Notes on setting up your machine](http://cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io/2015/08/03/recommended.html)
 - [Notes: Performance analysis basics](http://cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io/2015/08/10/performance.html)
 - [Narrated slides on some performance basics (also done in class)](http://cornell-cs5220-f15.github.io/slides/2015-08-27-perf.html)

There is a [https://github.com/cornell-cs5220-f15/lecture](lecture repository)
that contains in-class and pre-class questions.  If you're already a
savvy Git user, feel free to clone the repository and submit a pull
request (labeled as WIP) against the `lecture` repository.  If not,
we'll quickly walk through how to do this on Thursday -- bring your
laptop if you can.
