Intel is donating 15 Xeon Phi 5110P boards, $25K for host systems, and
access to their software engineering tools in support of an effort to
develop parallel computing curricular materials.  The system will be
used in the Fall 2015 offering of CS 5220, Applications of Parallel
Computers, and material from the class will be made available online.

CS5220 is taken not only by CS majors, but by a wide variety of
computationally-oriented graduate students from fields across campus
who use high-performance computing in their research.  Since the
course is currently offered every other year, I know that the
materials I’ve put online from previous offerings have been used
locally for self-study by several graduate students.

The Xeon Phi accelerators are becoming more common in a variety of
high-performance computing installations, both in clusters operated in
academia and research and in the big supercomputers operated by NSF
and DOE.  Xeon Phi accelerators are available in the Stampede system
at Texas and in the supercomputer at Minessota, and are a major part
of the next-generation Aurora supercomputer that Intel recently
contracted to build at Argonne National Lab.  I’m very excited to be
able to help train our students to be able to use these types of
resources.

Thanks to a discount offered by Dell (since this is for a course, with
another vendor also donating), the boards will be housed in an 8-node
dual-CPU cluster, so the total number of CPUs available will be

$$
  60 \frac{\mbox{cores}}{\mbox{accelerator}} \times
  15 \mbox{ accelerators} +
  12 \frac{\mbox{cores}}{\mbox{node}} \times
  8 \mbox{ nodes} = 996 \mbox{ cores}.
